## Local URLs with Portless

The standard development command uses [Portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless).
Install its pinned CLI once with Node.js 24 or newer, then run this repository's command after the
normal dependency and environment setup:

```sh
npm install -g portless@0.15.7
pnpm dev
```

The main checkout uses `https://documentation.localhost` with the default proxy settings.
Use the URL printed by Portless if you have changed its proxy port, TLS, or TLD.
Linked Git worktrees get a branch prefix, so each checkout has its own origin.
The first HTTPS run can request local administrator permission to bind port 443,
trust its development certificate, and synchronize local hostnames. Ctrl+C stops
the child server and removes its route. The direct fallback below starts the
server without the proxy.

Use `pnpm dev:direct` for the existing `http://localhost:3000` workflow.
